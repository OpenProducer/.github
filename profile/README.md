OpenProducer is a collective of like-minded developers, designers, producers, educators, and innovators who provide media producers and community members access to open tools, knowledge, and opportunities that empower them to create their best work. 

### We do this in the following ways
- Connect individuals and organizations with similar goals and interests to develop, support and sustain open source tools for producing, publishing, broadcasting, and distributing media.
- Create or extend hands-on training that can be delivered virtually or in local communities via meetups and hackathons. 
- Provide access to free tools and training enabling individuals to express themselves and groups to advance their mission.
